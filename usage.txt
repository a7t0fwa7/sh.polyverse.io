Usage: plv <subcommand>

Available subcommands:

 help               Display help.
 list-installed     List installed packages, version and source repo. Useful
                    to check whether an installed package came from Polyverse.
 scan               Recursively scans all the executables and provides output
                    that indicates whether the binary is scrambled.
 extract-rpm        Recursively scans all the executables from the current 
                    directory and compares the relative path/filename to the 
                    executables in an .rpm. If there's a match, the current 
                    binary is replaced with the one from the .rpm file. More
                    info available with --help. 
 fix_dpkg_status    apt-based installations may incorrectly mark an identical
                    package coming from repo.polyverse.io as "upgrade" instead
                    of "reinstall". This is due to slight differences in the
                    packages metadata (e.g., "Installed-Size:"). This subcommand
                    will reconcile these records in /var/lib/dpkg/status.
 scan-pid           Scan all mapped memory in a PID for a string (e.g. "-PV-").
 scan-pname         Scan all all processes that match parameter 1 and for each
                    of those processes, get list of open .so files and look for
                    see the number of times that the string given in parameter 2
                    is found.
 scan-gadgets       Presently will scan "/usr/lib64/libc-2.17.so" for the
                    following gadgets in the corresponding .text section.:
                    pop %rdx
                    pop %rdi
                    pop %rsi
