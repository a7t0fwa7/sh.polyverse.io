Usage: plv <subcommand>

Available subcommands:

 help               Display help.
 list-installed     List installed packages, version and source repo. Useful
                    to check whether an installed package came from Polyverse.
 fix_dpkg_status    apt-based installations may incorrectly mark an identical
                    package coming from repo.polyverse.io as "upgrade" instead
                    of "reinstall". This is due to slight differences in the
                    packages metadata (e.g., "Installed-Size:"). This subcommand
                    will reconcile these records in /var/lib/dpkg/status.
