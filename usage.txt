usage: curl -s https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s <subcommand> [<options>]

Available subcommands:

fix_dpkg_status           apt-based installations may incorrectly mark an identical package coming from repo.polyverse.io as "upgrade" instead of "reinstall". This is due to slight differences in the packages metadata (e.g., "Installed-Size:"). This subcommand will reconcile these records in /var/lib/dpkg/status.
get-package-url           give it an rpm/deb/apk package name and get url from official repo.
list-installed           List installed packages, version and source repo.
scan-pid           Scan all mapped memory in a PID for a string (e.g. "-PV-").
scan-pname           Scan all all processes that match parameter 1 and for each of those processes, get list of open .so files and look for see the number of times that the string given in parameter 2 is found.

For help on a subcommand, run `curl https://sh.polyverse.io | sh -s <subcommand> --help`.
